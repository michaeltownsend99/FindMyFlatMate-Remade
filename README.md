# FindMyFlatMateRemade
FindMyFlatMate is a site for students to advertise vacant rooms in their student homes that need to be filled for the next academic year.
This is based on a my own experience when at University, where the only way to find a vacancy in a house would be to scroll through a very large
Facebook page with hundreds of daily posts, making it hard to find previous listings.

This project is based on a website created by me and three others at GreatUniHack 2018 which I have decided to recreate to make it more functional
and user friendly.
